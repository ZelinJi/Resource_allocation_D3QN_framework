# Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Cellular Networks with Device-to-Device Users

Z. Ji, Z. Qin and C. G. Parini, "Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Cellular Networks with Device-to-Device Users,", IEEE Transactions on Communications, 2022.


Trained and tested with Python 3.8 + TensorFlow 2.4.1. 

How to use the code:

- To train the DDQN resource allocation model: Please run "main_marl_train.py".
- To train the benchmark DQN model: Please run "main_marl_train.py" and revise the 'IS_double_q' parameter.
- To test the resource allocation models please run: "main_test.py".
- Please run the "RIS_run.py" to optimize RIS.
- Fig.4 and 5 can be reproduced by running "RIS_run.py" and "main_test.py", other results can be obtained from recording returns and results during training.
