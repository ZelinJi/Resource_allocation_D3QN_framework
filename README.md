# Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Cellular Networks with Device-to-Device Users

Trained and tested with Python 3.8 + TensorFlow 2.4.1. 

How to use the code:

- To train the DDQN resource allocation model: Please run "main_marl_train.py".
- To train the benchmark DQN model: Please run "main_marl_train.py" and revise the 'IS_double_q' parameter.
- Please run the "RIS_run.py" to optimize RIS.
- Due to the iterations, the coding might be slightly different from the original version.
